We study the long-run impacts of local area exposures to US bombing in Cambodia on health outcomes among those residing in these locations many years later. Our study is separate from those that focus on the impact of being exposed to bombings as a child; rather, we study how conflicts can map to health outcomes for future generations. Using a wide range of geo-coded data and a spatial regression discontinuity adapted to many boundaries, we find that the long-term health impacts of past bombings vary significantly by location, depending on whether the bombs still influence activities today. We find that in areas where pre-bombing soil was infertile, harder ground, and unexploded ordinance (UXO) is less likely, local area exposure to past bombing has positive effects on health, indicated by higher Height-for-age Z-scores, a decreased likelihood of being underweight or suffering from anemia. In contrast, fertile areas, softer ground, where bombs were more likely to fail and UXO remains a threat show either null or harmful effects. We then utilize numerous data sources to show that local economic development and improved access to health facilities are likely mechanisms explaining the positive effects in low UXO locations today. In regions free from the dangers of UXO, significant investments in economic activities and healthcare infrastructure have mitigated the negative effects of past bombing, even improving health outcomes post-conflict. However, in areas where UXO remains a threat, development has been hindered, and negative impacts persist. Our results overall offer an important lesson that while conflicts can be harmful, their impacts on future generations can be mitigated through investments in the post-conflict era, as long as remnants of war no longer remain.

  <summary> Abstract</summary>
We study the long-run impacts of local area exposures to US bombing in Cambodia on health outcomes among those residing in these locations many years later. We leverage geo-coded individual data and a spatial regression discontinuity adapted to many boundaries. Our study is separate from those that focus on the impact of being exposed to bombings as a child; rather, we study how such disasters can map to health outcomes for future generations. We show that in fact, regions directly affected by bombings exhibit better health outcomes compared to those just beyond the bombing boundaries, indicated by higher Height-for-age Z-scores and a decreased likelihood of anemia. This result remains robust to a variety of potential threats to identification. We then leverage a wide range of data to show that improvements in soil fertility and access to health facilities are likely mechanisms explaining the observed enhancements in health outcomes. Our evidence suggests that in the post-conflict period, infrastructure development favored areas that experienced greater degradation in the past. Our results overall offer an important lesson that while disasters can have harmful impacts, how outcomes are transformed for future generations will depend. Put differently, disaster is not necessarily destiny"</details>-->

**The Intergenerational Effects of Sibling Size on Health: Evidence from One-Child Policy in China** (with Zhan Shi)
<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('chinaonechild')">Abstract</a> | [Draft][china-draft] ] </small> 

<div id="chinaonechild" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
We study the spillover effects of China’s one-child policy on the health outcomes of subsequent generations. Despite extensive research on the effects of family size on education, few studies have examined the policy’s effects on health, especially across generations. Focusing on urban Han Chinese from the China Family Panel Studies data,we use a reduced form regression discontinuity design (RDD) to isolate the local average treatment effect of the policy. The results indicate that children of policy-affected parents show significant improvements in physical and mental health, which can be attributed to increased parental investment and care and improved parental health outcomes. Our findings contribute to the literature on the intergenerational transmission of health and quantity-quality trade-offs, and highlight how family planning policies can have lasting health effects across generations.
